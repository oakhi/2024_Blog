    "text": "Dad enjoyed and followed sports, especially if it was an international match involving the Korean National Football Team.\nHe would listen, watch, every chance he got, to the World Cup, Asia Cup, or even friendlies.\nAnd he was also a tough critic.\nLike most older persons, he felt those younger person could do better, far better.\nPerhaps forgetting that the competition and the game has gotten more intense and evolved since he last participated.\nRecently had a chance to participate, as my father did, and followed the 대한민국 축구 국가대표팀1 in action.\nThey were participating in Asian Football Confederation Cup, the 2023 AFC Asian Cup held in Qatar.\nThought I had outgrown the period when my father followed the National Team of his birth.\nBy watching the game, for 90 minutes or 2 hours, dad was was able to forget that he was abroad and take part along with his fellow countrymen in cheering and criticizing the players.\nThe advancement of video recording and streaming has altered the game viewing.\nOne can get the gist of the match by viewing the 10 or 15 minutes of highlights.\nHowever, the real highlight for the players, those participating in attendance or using technology should be the singing of the national anthem.\nA reason for these tournament is to decide who is best in a given match, on a given day, under the circumstances that fate or luck provides.\nThe more enduring purpose is to showcase the progress of a nation on an international stage, both as a sports nation and a society.\nBased on what I have observed and my personal feelings, the nation of Korea should be proud of its team.\nThe Korea team knows itself, despite friendly and not so friendly critiques and their suggestions.\nThe Korea team also knows the competition\nThe members of its team has participated in highest levels of competition abroad.\nThey have demonstrated, that they belong on an international stage. For they not only surpassed the minimum requirements but are playing at an exceptionally high level in terms of ideals of a sport.\nBuilding on that moral victory, by the players on the field of play and in the hearts of its cheering fans, the ultimate goal can be realized.\nThe ideal of representing a nation and lifting the spirit of its citizens via good sportsmanship - whether in victory or in defeat."
